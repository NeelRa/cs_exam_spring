1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
public class Smartphone extends Technology{
   
   int number;
   
   public Smartphone(String name, int number){
      super(name);
      this.number=number;}
      
   public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name +. + "My number is " + number +".");}
      
   
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Technology that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.
==> POLYMORPHISM is something that can be modified and can change its state to be used differently. It is an object that can change its state. 
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
==> Method overriding.
